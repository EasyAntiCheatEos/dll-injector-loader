# KeyAuth Loader - C++ Source Code

This is a C++ loader I developed that utilizes [KeyAuth](https://keyauth.cc/) to download and manually map a DLL into a target process. Originally intended for a paid project, the buyer didn't follow through with the purchase, so I'm releasing the source code here for free.

## Features
- **KeyAuth Integration**: Securely download the DLL using KeyAuth.
- **Manual DLL Mapping**: The loader manually maps the DLL into the target process.
- **Included Libraries**: All necessary libraries are included in the repository.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the loader as per your requirements.
